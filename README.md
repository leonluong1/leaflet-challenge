# Earthquake Data Visualization
Module 15 Leaflet Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about visualizing recent earthquakes around the globe as well as documenting their magnitude, depth and time of occurrence. We use JavaScript with the Leaflet library to visualize the data. We gathered earthquake data from the United States Geological Survery (USGS) [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and tectonic plate data [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_plates.json).

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my JavaScript, D3, Leaflet and GeoJSON knowledge. I used D3 to scrape the earthquake data from the USGS website. Then, I created a web page that plotted the world map and put markers to indicate where earthquakes happened. Then, I created a layer to indicate where tectonic plates were located. Finally, I also included a toggle switch for the different layers as well as a legend indicate the depths of the earthquakes.

The file types in this repository are html, js, css, json and png files.
